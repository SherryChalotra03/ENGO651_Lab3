In this project, you’ll build a web mapping application about building permits in Calgary. Users will be able to filter and visualize building permits in Calgary in a mapping front-end. You will use City of Calgary’s Open Calgary API to pull in building permits data. Users will be able to query for date ranges via the Open Calgary API.
